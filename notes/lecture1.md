## What is an operating system

> Special layer of software that provides application software access to hardware resources.

- Convenient abstraction of complex hardware devices
- Protected access to shared resources
- Security and authentication
- Communication amongst logical entities

> An operating system is a referee
- Manages sharing of resources, protection and isolation

> An operating system is an illusionist
- Provides clean, easy to use abstractions of physical resources

> An operating system is a glue
- Glues common services together

## Conclusion

- Operating systems provide a virtual machine abstraction to handle diverse hardware. They simplify application development by providing standard services.
- Operating systems coordinate resources and protect users from each other. They can provide an array of fault containment, fault tolerance, and fault recovery.
